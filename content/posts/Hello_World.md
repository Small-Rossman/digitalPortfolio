# Beginning my Journey

I've always been interested in computers & technology; the world of video gaming introduced me to the wonders of tech from a very young age, I yet still remember the day me and my brother sat down in front of his Playstation 2, to play the newly released 'Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas', and I remember thinking it was a marvel, a completely digital world? Filled with people, places, and things to do? To this day, video games still amaze me, the level of fidelity and interactivity modern video games it parallel to no other form of media today.

As I grew older, video games inflamed into a burning passion, it became what I wanted to do, make *my own* world, *my own* rules, tell *my own* stories, rule *my own* kingdom. But as my school years passed, my siblings moved away, I began to mature and refocus my passion into what really inspired me about video games: **the technology behind them**.

# Learning the Ropes

I was a lazy teenager, most of what I learned at school came easy to me, I flew through my classes and my exams with very little trouble, but I had failed to learn one crucial aspect of life: I hadn't learned to fail at all. When University reared it's head, and the workload was finally placed on **me**, I fell apart, I still remember crying to a friend over my first ever failed exam: Databases, of all things.

When COVID-19 eventually came and offered me an escape back home, and I took it without a second thought. I feel we all agree that COVID was a time of purgatory, nothing moved or progressed, and I agree much myself, my skills & career remained as they were, as we remained couped up uncomfortably close to our families, I began to search for other option, other paths I could take to progress my passions.

I spent months working from hospitality job to hospitality job, like goldilocks trying to find the perfect bed, before I finally found a place that would allow me to apply my digital skills, now I sit here, spending my free time teaching myself the technical world, progressing my Cybersecurity degree, and using the skills I learn to make the lives of my peers easier, but I want to learn *more*.

# I am an Amateur

As you can likely see from this website in it's current iteration, I am but still an **Amateur**, the digital world likes to think of itself as accessible and easy to learn, but it is nothing of the sort, it requires your full attention, motivation, and more to learn and draw from.

But I hope you can appreaciate the work that I am doing, that you can hopefully see progress as this site ages; We all go through a journey to get to where we are now, respect that, it isn't finished until we die.
